This is a quick :car: backend for the corresponding [new-edit-blog-fe repo](https://github.com/kclowes/new-edit-blog-fe):
It uses [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)


#### To use:
- Clone this repo
- Start the server: `json-server --watch db.json`
- Then, you can either manually add items to `db.json` or you can use RESTful routing to PUT, POST, PATCH, or DELETE routes.
- Your routes will be determined by the `db.json` file.
